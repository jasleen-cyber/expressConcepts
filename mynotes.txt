starting with express after node farm project
it is abstraction of node js , so help us to write node js code faster and help with complex routing

we will work on project tours


it will help us to learn how to create REST ful APIs

in request and response, 
they are bit different in express than in node
in express they have a lot more data and methods/functions on them




-----------------
express
----------------

res.send - sends back string to the client
we can do same with
res.json
better for when using postman

//res.status(200).send("hello from the server babe")
res.json(200).send("hello from the server babe")
in the above .json sets the content type to json
